# üì± Mobile QoE Collection Application REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS - TASK 3

## Project Overview
A Quality of Experience (QoE) application designed to address declining customer satisfaction in Cameroon's telecom industry by collecting user feedback and network performance metrics with precise location data.

## üîç Problem Statement
Our research revealed:
- Average customer satisfaction rating of **only 2.2/5**
- **43%** of users rated their network at the lowest satisfaction level
- **85%** use multiple SIM cards from different providers
- **74%** regularly switch providers during network problems

This low customer loyalty directly impacts telecom companies' financial performance, as acquiring new customers costs approximately **seven times more** than retaining existing ones.

## üí° Solution
The QoE mobile application allows users to:
1. Rate their current network experience (1-5 scale)
2. Report common issues (slow internet, poor coverage, etc.)
3. Add optional comments for detailed feedback

While also passively collecting:
- Signal strength data
- Network type information
- Precise GPS coordinates
- Current operator information

## üéØ Key Focus Areas (MVP v1.0)
- Simple User Feedback
- Accurate Location Tagging
- Basic Network Context
- Anonymity and Security
- Reliable Data Transmission

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React Native (cross-platform, native API access, performance optimization)
- **Backend:** Firebase (offline persistence, real-time database, authentication)
